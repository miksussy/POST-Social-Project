# POST-Social-Project

## Installation Guide

To install the modules required, open installmodules.bat

OR run this command in the folder.
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Or if you're a raging psycopath, you can do these:
`pip install requests`
`pip install flask`

## Explaination of this project

This is a social project, letting people POST JSON to the server, and it will display it.
It's very shoddy, it's my first attempt at a flask "API".

### Dangers
People may upload illegal content, not my fault lmao. You can wipe POSTed data by sending blank JSON data, or going into the templates folder.
